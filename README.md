# VoltRunningApp Overview
This is a full-stack running tracker web app built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and SQL, designed for deployment on Render (2025). It uses GPS or motion sensors to track user runs—even with the screen off.

Key features include:

📊 Run Stats & Comparisons: View total miles by day, week, or month, and compare across timeframes

👟 Run Logging: Each run logs pace, GPS route, duration, shoes used, and personal notes

🏃 Personal Bests: Tracks best 1K, 5K, 10K, and 13K runs; auto-updates when a new best is logged

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social Features: Add friends and see their total mileage and recent run stats

🏅 Badges System: Earn badges for achievements like beating your best 5K, running 10 miles in a month, or completing seasonal runs (e.g., 4th of July, Thanksgiving)
